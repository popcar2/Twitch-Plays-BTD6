# Twitch_Plays_BTD6

## Want to see what it looks like in action? Check out [this Twitch vod!](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/1491929331)

A very work in progress program to allow Twitch chat to play BTD6. The program reads Twitch chat on your channel and collects commands from users. Then, after X seconds, 
it collects all the votes and activates the most popular vote.

It does this by using your mouse and keyboard to interact with the game through clicking and hotkeys. Essentially, it's just a really advanced macro tied to Twitch chat.

In the future I hope to restrict inputs to the game window and add an overlay that dynamically shows the timer, possible commands, current most popular vote, among other things.

This program is also as light as a feather, the exe sits at <500kb and uses around 5mb of ram.
